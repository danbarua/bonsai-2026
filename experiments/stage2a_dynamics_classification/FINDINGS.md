# Stage 2A: Feasibility Stage 1

**Status: mechanical validation only, per `DESIGN.md`'s own explicit
framing. This is NOT a scientific result and must not be read as one.**
Its job is to confirm the pipeline runs correctly end-to-end at a small
scale before scaling up -- effect direction is recorded below because
`DESIGN.md` permits it, but nothing here is confirmatory.

## Scope

1,000 official KMNIST training images (100/class, class-stratified,
`SEED=42`), drawn deterministically from the official training split
only -- the official test set was never loaded in this stage. Three
conditions, per `DESIGN.md`'s locked pipeline:

1. Raw pixels (784-dim).
2. Encoded, pre-graph-evolution (`_local_converged_phases`, restricted
   to T's 505 active nodes, reference-node gauge, 1008-dim).
3. Evolved on T (`T_HORIZON=2.5`, same gauge, 1008-dim).

## Go/no-go mechanical checks (all passed)

- **Solver failures: 0/1000 (0.0%)**, well under the locked 0.1%
  tolerance. Every graph-evolution ODE solve succeeded on its primary
  attempt (`RK45`, `max_step=0.05`) -- the recovery policy (smaller
  `max_step`, then `Radau`) was never invoked.
- **Non-finite feature vectors: 0.** Every raw-pixel, pre-evolution, and
  evolved-T feature vector was fully finite.
- **`R(theta)` diagnostic** (order parameter, pre- and post-evolution,
  reported per `DESIGN.md` -- never used to alter the gauge):
  - Pre-evolution: min 0.403, max 0.979, mean 0.735, median 0.743. 0
    images below 0.01, 0 above 0.99.
  - Post-evolution: min 0.616, max 0.992, mean 0.859, median 0.869. 0
    images below 0.01, **1 of 1000 above 0.99** (max 0.9922). A single
    boundary case, not a mass concentration at the numerical limit --
    disclosed as required, not flagged as a pathology.
  - Evolution consistently increases `R` (mean 0.735 -> 0.859) across
    this sample -- plausible given T's coupling drives phases toward
    local synchrony, reported as an observation, not interpreted further
    at this stage.
- **Reference-node gauge**: the two trivially-constant columns
  (`theta_ref`'s own `cos=1, sin=0`) were confirmed dropped on every
  image via the assertion inside `reference_node_features()` (also
  covered by `tests/test_stage2a_core.py`) -- effective feature
  dimension 1008 throughout, as designed.
- **Classifier convergence**: all three conditions converged in every
  fold/`C` combination of the locked 5-fold-CV x 9-value grid (45 fits
  per condition, 135 total) -- the `NonConvergenceError` stop-gate was
  never triggered.

**Overall: GO.** Pipeline runs correctly end-to-end at this scale;
nothing here blocks proceeding to feasibility stage 2.

## Effect direction (descriptive only, not inferential)

Mean 5-fold cross-validated log-loss at each condition's own
CV-selected `C` (selected independently per condition, per the locked
procedure):

| condition | dim | selected C | mean CV log-loss at selected C |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| raw pixels | 784 | 0.01 | 0.804 |
| encoded, pre-evolution | 1008 | 0.01 | 0.843 |
| evolved on T | 1008 | 0.01 | 0.804 |

At this sample size (1,000 images, 100/class, no held-out test set --
this is a training-side CV number, not the locked primary endpoint),
evolved-T's mean CV log-loss is nominally equal to raw pixels' and
nominally *lower* than the pre-evolution condition's. **This is not
evidence of anything** -- `DESIGN.md` is explicit that the feasibility
ladder may report raw differences descriptively without formal
inference, and 1,000 images with no dedicated held-out set is far too
small and methodologically different from the locked confirmatory test
(20,000-resample paired bootstrap against 10,000 official test images)
to support any claim in either direction. Recorded here only because
the design permits recording it, not because it means anything yet.

## Runtime

1,000-image pipeline (encode + restrict + evolve + both gauge
computations, parallelized across `cpu_count()-1` workers): **65.7s
(65.7 ms/image)**. Classifier fitting (3 conditions x 45 fold/C fits
each): a few seconds, not separately timed. Extrapolating linearly to
stage 2 (5,000 images) and stage 3 (60,000 images) suggests roughly
5.5 minutes and 66 minutes respectively for the pipeline stage alone --
a rough projection to revisit with stage 2's own measurement, not a
locked estimate.

## Code

`stage2a_core.py` (encoding/restriction/evolution/gauge features),
`stage2a_classifier.py` (locked CV/standardization/classifier
procedure), `run_feasibility_stage1.py` (this stage's driver),
`tests/test_stage2a_core.py` (reference-node constant-column property
and evolution-recovery-policy ordering, Tier 1 + Tier 2). Raw results
(`results/stage1_feasibility_results.pkl`) are gitignored, regenerable
by re-running `run_feasibility_stage1.py`.

## Next step

Feasibility stage 2 (up to 5,000 official-training images, throughput
measurement, and the encoder-seed robustness check), per `DESIGN.md`'s
locked ladder -- not started here.
